chart parent
	chart has location data and create AP transformation
	add_star (where astro-coordinate transformations happen)
		star should come out with (RA, DEC) and (ALT,AZ)
	add_sso (where astro-coordinate transformations happen)
	change coordinates to xy image coordinates function (abstract)
	plot - take paper coordinates and put on paper (abstract, cause each plot will handle star attributes differently)
	    i.e. it will take the star max and min magnitude and do different thing with it
	radialchart
	squarechart
